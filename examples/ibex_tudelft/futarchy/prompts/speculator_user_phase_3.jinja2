Instructions for this phase:

1. **Game Information**:
   - Phase: {{ meta.phase_name }} (Phase {{ meta.phase }})
   - Your Role: Speculator (Player #{{ meta.player_number }})
   - Name: {{ meta.player_name }}

2. **Available Information**:
  2.1. **Declarations**:
      {% for declaration in private_information.declarations %}
      {% set role_name = "Speculator" if declaration["role"] == 1 else "Developer" if declaration["role"] == 2 else "Owner" %}
      {% set declared_value_no_project = declaration["d"][0] %}
      {% set declared_value_project = declaration["d"][1] %}

      {% if declaration["role"] == 2 %}
        {% set min_value_no_project = public_information.boundaries["developer"]["noProject"]["low"] %}
        {% set max_value_no_project = public_information.boundaries["developer"]["noProject"]["high"] %}
        {% set min_value_project = public_information.boundaries["developer"]["projectA"]["low"] %}
        {% set max_value_project = public_information.boundaries["developer"]["projectA"]["high"] %}
        {% set percentile_no_project = ((declared_value_no_project - min_value_no_project) / (max_value_no_project - min_value_no_project) * 100) | round(2) %}
        {% set percentile_project = ((declared_value_project - min_value_project) / (max_value_project - min_value_project) * 100) | round(2) %}
        - Player #{{ declaration["number"] }} ({{ role_name }}), declared value: {{ declared_value_no_project }} (no project), {{ declared_value_project }} (project), percentile: {{ percentile_no_project }}% (no project), {{ percentile_project }}% (project)
      {% else %}
        - Player #{{ declaration["number"] }} ({{ role_name }}), declared value: {{ declared_value_no_project }} (no project), {{ declared_value_project }} (project)
      {% endif %}
      {% endfor %}


  2.2. **Real Value Boundaries**:
    {% for role, conditions in public_information.boundaries.items() %}
    - {{ role }}:
      {% for condition, bounds in conditions.items() %}
      - {{ condition }}: {{ bounds.low }} to {{ bounds.high }}
      {% endfor %}
    {% endfor %}

3. **Your Decision to Make**:
   - Decide which properties to purchase based on their declared values and your assessment of true value
   - You can purchase the properties of multiple players under the same condition or different conditions, choose not to buy a property, or purchase the same property under both conditions.
   - You should make a list of the id of the players whose property you want to purchase under the condition noProject: [<player_id>,<player_id>].
   - You should make a list of the id of the players whose property you want to purchase under the condition projectA: [<player_id>,<player_id>, <player_id>].
   - You should combine these two lists in a list of lists: [[<player_id>, <player_id>], [<player_id>, <player_id>, <player_id>]] and place this list of lists in the snipe field.

   - Provide the output as a JSON object:
    {
      "gameId": {{ meta.game_id }},
      "type": "done-speculating",
      "snipe": [[<player_id>, <player_id>], [<player_id>, <player_id>, <player_id>]],
    }

    Example:
    If you want to purchase the properties of player 1, 2 and 4 under the condition noProject and purchache the property of player 2 under the condition projectA, you would provide the following JSON object:
    {
      "gameId": 1,
      "type": "done-speculating",
      "snipe": [[1, 2, 4], [2]],
    }
